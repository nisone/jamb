Being human, we have at last revolted against that senseless waste. We have started to impose on nature’s heartless play a humane new order of our own. But, when once man has begun to interfere with nature, he cannot afford to stop half way.

The conscientious journalist must check any tendency to basis, and guard against the dangers inherent in personal antipathies or friendships, and in traditional opposition between rival schools of thought. When a political opponent, whose stupidity habitually provokes attack, makes an effective speech, honesty requires that he be given credit for it.

Whereas in lower mountains and on easy ground the weather may  be no more than a handicap, in the high Himalayas it is decisive, regardless of terrain. The deduction to be drawn from these two factors was clear enough. We must either so fortify ourselves that we could continue, without detriment, to live and have our being above the limit of natural acclimatization, or, better still, we must solve the problem of speed. It was desirable, in fact, that we should meet both these requirements and thus give to those chosen to attempt the summit and to their supporting teams some measure of insurance against the vagaries of the weather, for safety in mountain climbing is as much a matter of swiftness as of sureness of foot.
